### Building TAP from source code
---

@@toc { depth=5 }

#### Product Dependencies

The following products are required to build and run TAP, and to potentially
help you contribute to the TAP project.
They are basically the tools required to run an SBT play application.
Other dependencies are also specified in build.sbt and will be automatically
downloaded during the first build.

Many of the tools/products will be downloaded during the build as build.sbt dependencies
or indirectly by other products.
Perhaps you want to **start with cloning and building TAP, then refer to the list in
this section in response to errors to see what you might be missing**.

1. Git

    You will need the Git source control command line tools and/or a Git gui
    interface if you want to clone and contribute to the project, otherwise you
    can just download a zip of the source code.

    The git tools are available either through your software installation tool such as Synaptic or
    from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com).

2. sbt

    sbt will build the project and download much of the needed software for us, but if it is not
    on our system already, we need to download it first.
    Even if sbt is already installed, we may need to use a different level of sbt to do the build.

    Once you downloaded the code, position in the ~/tap directory, and issue the following command :

        sbt about

    in the ~/tap directory.
    You should get the following output :

        [info] This is sbt 0.13.16
        [info] The current project is {file:~/tap/}tap 3.0.4or
        [info] The current project is built against Scala 2.12.3

    If the sbt version is different from than 0.13.16, wait until the first compile is done, and issue
    the check again as the sbt build should download the correct version for you.
    If not, download the the 0.13.16 version that is used in the project from the [sbt website](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

3. Scala

    The Scala compiler version used to compile the code is 2.12.3.
    This should match the run-time Scala version as Scala run-time is not
    backward compatible.
    This should be taken care of by the build.sbt file on the first compile.

    You can issue the following command to check your Scala version:

        scala -version

    This is the expected output:

        Scala code runner version 2.12.3 -- Copyright 2002-2017, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.:

4. Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java run-time (JRE)

    Check that you have an up to date version of the JRE.
    It should be at least 1.8 (The build is tested using 1.8), otherwise you have to update
    the Java run time on your machine.

    Issue:

        java -version

    The JDK is also needed to compile java files in the project, and should also be at the 1.8
    level. Issue :

        javac -version

    If the JDK or JRE are missing or at an older level, the 1.8 level can be downloaded
    from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

    Installing the JDK should take care of installing the JRE also.

    You should provide enough memory for the JDK and JRE to build and run this project. While TAP will run with standard memory settings, certain NLP processes which require the loading of large models will require additional memory.
    
    The following values are suggested :

       -Xmx4096M -Xss1M

5. The Play Framework

    This can be downloaded from the [Play Framework website](https://playframework.com).

    Press on the Download 2.6.6 button and follow the appropriate instructions for your
    operating system.


#### Getting a local copy of the source code

1. Clone the github repository to your local repository copy on your PC, or
download the zip file if you just want to build the project, and have no intention
to submit a contribution.

To clone the project, position to the directory where you want the local repository placed
(Your home directory is fine) and issue the following command.
This will create a copy of the repository in the tap directory.

        git clone https://github.com/uts-cic/tap.git

2. The following jar files should also be placed in the lib directory:
   (Note that the models jar is relatively large at around 750M so it might take
   some time to download depending on your internet speed).


        [tap-models-jar](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev-tap-cic-uts/cc.factorie.app.nlp.all-models-1.0.0.jar)
        [tap-factorie-jar](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev-tap-cic-uts/nlpfactorie_2.12-0.1.jar)

    Copy the files to the lib directory:

        cd ~/tap
        mkdir -p lib
        cd lib
        wget https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev-tap-cic-uts/cc.factorie.app.nlp.all-models-1.0.0.jar
        wget https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev-tap-cic-uts/nlpfactorie_2.12-0.1.jar

3. For Word Vector, a pre-trained model from Google News should be downloaded here: 

        [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)

    Create models/googleNews directory:

        cd ~/tap/models
        mkdir -p googleNews

    Copy the downloaded file to the models/googleNews directory.


#### Building TAP

(1) Move to the directory where you placed the tap product. Assuming it is in the home directory, you should see a build.sbt file containing instruction on how the build is done, as well as this README.md file:

```bash
cd ~/tap
```

        
(2) Create a ```LocalSbtSettings.scala``` file in the ```project``` directory. This will hold your specific settings for your build:
    
    import sbt._
    
    object LocalSbtSettings {
    
      val githubBaseUrl = "https://github.com/uts-cic/tap" //Change this to your fork
      val scaladocApiBaseUrl = "https://uts-cic.github.io/tap" //Change this to your fork
      
      val dockerRepoURI = "the.url.to.publish.docker.images.to"
    }
    

(3) Compile the product.

The first compile will be very slow as dependencies have to be fetched and placed
in the ```~/.ivy2 directory```.

```bash
sbt compile
```

The following compile warnings seem to be safe to ignore, but ensure the
last compile ends with [SUCCESS] :

```sbtshell
  com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.12:2.5.6 is selected over {2.5.4, 2.5.3, 2.4.19}
  com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.12:2.5.6 is selected over {2.5.4, 2.4.19}
  com.google.guava:guava:22.0 is selected over 19.0
  ...srcc/main/scala/handlers/GraphQlHandler.scala:42: match may not be exhaustive.
  ...
  there were 8 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
  two warnings found^[[0m
  Total time: 11 s, completed Oct 7, 2017 12:39:37 PM^[[0m
```


#### Running TAP

1. Move to the directory where you placed the tap product. Assuming it is
in the home directory:

        cd ~/tap

2. Ensure the JVM has enough memory to run the application.

        export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx2048M -Xss1M"

3. You can either run TAP using either of the following methods:

    - Using sbt:

        sbt run

    - Using play:
        play

        If you get an exception in the SBtParser as in the following lines :

            java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Position.start on class scala.reflect.internal.util.OffsetPosition
            at scala.reflect.internal.util.Position.start(Position.scala:114)
            at sbt.internals.parser.SbtParser.sbt$internals$parser$SbtParser$$convertStatement$1(SbtParser.scala:148)

        This means Play is picking up an old SBT Parser that cannot deal with parsing the latest layout of the SBT files
        as explained in this exchange: [play-parse-bug](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1739)

        In order to avoid this error, and run the application with play, you should update play to use the 2.10.4
        Parser which is the minimum level parser that fixes the error.
        This update will take a long time to run, but is a one off.

            SBT_SCALA_VERSION=2.10.4 play update

        You then have to run play always specifying the SBT Scala version as described in the next step.

    - Using play, but determining the SBT Scala version

          This is necessary if you want to run play and need to avoid the SbtParser exception.

              SBT_SCALA_VERSION=2.10.4 play run

    After you run the TAP Server, you should see the following lines, indicating that the server is
    running and listening to requests :

        Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Xms512M -Xmx2048M -Xss1M
        [info] Loading global plugins from ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins
        [info] Loading project definition from ~/tap/project
        [info] Set current project to tap (in build file:~/tap/)
        --- (Running the application, auto-reloading is enabled) ---
        [info] p.c.s.AkkaHttpServer - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000

    You can now connect to the server by typing the following in your browser:

        http://localhost:9000/

    The product should start and you can use it.
    You should see the following in your browser.

        TAP Server with GraphQL
        Use the graphiql IDE here

    To end the server, close your browser session then type return in your console
    where the server is running.
    The following message should appear on the console.

        [info] p.c.s.AkkaHttpServer - Stopping server...
