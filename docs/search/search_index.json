They are basically the tools required to run an SBT play application. Other dependencies are also specified in build.sbt and will be automatically downloaded during the first build.\nMany of the tools/products will be downloaded during the build as build.sbt dependencies or indirectly by other products. Perhaps you want to start with cloning and building TAP, then refer to the list in this section in response to errors to see what you might be missing.\nGit You will need the Git source control command line tools and/or a Git gui interface if you want to clone and contribute to the project, otherwise you can just download a zip of the source code. The git tools are available either through your software installation tool such as Synaptic or from the Git website. sbt sbt will build the project and download much of the needed software for us, but if it is not on our system already, we need to download it first. Even if sbt is already installed, we may need to use a different level of sbt to do the build. Once you downloaded the code, position in the ~/tap directory, and issue the following command : sbt about\n in the ~/tap directory. You should get the following output : [info] This is sbt 0.13.16\n[info] The current project is {file:~/tap/}tap 3.0.4or\n[info] The current project is built against Scala 2.12.3\n If the sbt version is different from than 0.13.16, wait until the first compile is done, and issue the check again as the sbt build should download the correct version for you. If not, download the the 0.13.16 version that is used in the project from the sbt website Scala The Scala compiler version used to compile the code is 2.12.3. This should match the run-time Scala version as Scala run-time is not backward compatible. This should be taken care of by the build.sbt file on the first compile. You can issue the following command to check your Scala version: scala -version\n This is the expected output: Scala code runner version 2.12.3 -- Copyright 2002-2017, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.:\n Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java run-time (JRE) Check that you have an up to date version of the JRE. It should be at least 1.8 (The build is tested using 1.8), otherwise you have to update the Java run time on your machine. Issue: java -version\n The JDK is also needed to compile java files in the project, and should also be at the 1.8 level. Issue : javac -version\n If the JDK or JRE are missing or at an older level, the 1.8 level can be downloaded from Oracle. Installing the JDK should take care of installing the JRE also. You should provide enough memory for the JDK and JRE to build and run this project. While TAP will run with standard memory settings, certain NLP processes which require the loading of large models will require additional memory. The following values are suggested : -Xmx4096M -Xss1M The Play Framework This can be downloaded from the Play Framework website.

If you have any suggestions for alternate ways of working with this project please let us know by opening an issue. Otherwise the following is a guide to getting setup with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nWhen you first open IntelliJ IDEA, We first want to ensure you have the correct plugins. Click configure at the bottom of the start screen and choose Plugins. Check that you have the ‘Scala’ and SBT plugins installed. If this is the first time you have run IntelliJ you most likely won’t. Click Browse Repositories at the bottom and type in Scala to search for it then click install plugin. Do the same for the plugin called SBT. Below is the plugins that you want to install. Once you have installed both plugins it will direct you to restart IntelliJ. Once restarted select ‘Import Project’ and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo too and choose the build.sbt file.\nMake sure Download library sources is ticked and that your Project JDK is chosen. If not you will need to select your JDK, You will need the 1.8 JRE and JDK found here. Then click the New Button > JDK and navigate to your java JRE In most cases it should be installed to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.x and click ok. Once you click ok IntelliJ may take a while syncing the project(20-40 minutes for first time) Keep an eye on the progress bar at the bottom and wait until it is complete. Once it has synced open the app folder and then open the view folder. Right click on HomePage and select ‘Run Play 2 App’ this will automatically generate your run configuration. It may also download a number of files that SBT needs which may take some time. Once it has compiled and built you may find it will crash with an Out Of Memory Error. Let’s fix that now. Go to the Run Menu at the top and choose ‘Edit Configuration’, There are a few things we want to change here. First we want to check that the URL to open is http://localhost:9000 Then we want to enter some custom JVM Options -Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M replacing whatever is already there. Lastly we want to enter some Environment Variables click the folder icon then the + symbol under ‘Name’ enter TAP_HOSTS and under ‘Value’ enter localhost:9000 Click Apply then ok. Great now you can right click HomePage again and select ‘Run Play 2 App’ and it should compile and load up the homepage. You are good to go! Try visiting the graphql interface and see what it can do!","title":"Working with Windows(7,10), Mac and Linux (Ubuntu Desktop) with IDEA Ultimate"},{"location":"/developer/contributing.html","text":"","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"/developer/contributing.html#contributing","text":"Would you like to contribute to this open source project.
