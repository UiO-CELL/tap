Virtualization is enabled in BIOS. Typically, virtualization is enabled by default. This is different from having Hyper-V enabled. For more detail see Virtualization must be enabled in Troubleshooting. CPU SLAT-capable feature. At least 4GB of RAM.\nIf you do not have windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education, Please use Docker Toolbox.\nThis is the easiest way to get started with docker and TAP. Windows 10 has an app called Docker For Windows which will handle everything automatically for you. See How To install Docker For Windows\nEnsure you have docker for windows installed and it is running. First, quickly create a virtual switch for your virtual machine (VM) to use, so they can use your network adapter. Launch Hyper-V Manager Click Virtual Switch Manager in the right-hand menu Click Create Virtual Switch of type External Give it the name “myswitch”, and check the box to share your host machine’s active network adapter Now create a VM we can use to run TAP on. (You may need to run this in admin, press windows key + x > Command Prompt (Admin)) docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-memory 2048  --hyperv-virtual-switch \"myswitch\" myvm1\n Notice we are passing in some custom variables We are giving it 2gb of ram We are choosing the switch we just created “myswitch” We are naming it “myvm1” Once it is created, verify that it is running and write down it’s IP. (here mine is 10.1.1.190) docker-machine ls\n To control your newly created docker machine there is a simple command you can run docker-machine env myvm1\n This will return a command you can run in order to automatically send your docker commands to your vm. (the last line minus the REM) Yours may be different than mine, be sure to run whatever command your terminal returns. run that command @FOR /f \"tokens=*\" %i IN ('docker-machine env myvm1') DO @%i\n Now any docker commands we run will run on the machine we created! Now let’s get TAP running. run docker run and pass in a number of parameters docker run -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M\" -e TAP_HOSTS=\"10.1.1.190:9000\" -e TAP_SECRET=\"test\" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2\n There are a few parameters here: JAVA_OPTS is passing in our custom java environment variables which allow us to increase the amount of memory the application can use. TAP_HOSTS is telling our application which IP is authorised to use our application, In this case you need to pass in your machine IP you wrote down earlier. In my case it is 10.1.1.190:9000 TAP_SECRET is a secret variable we can pass through to our application to ensure we are allowed to run the image. in this case just include “test” -p tells the docker machine which port to use, So we are mapping our Port 9000 to the machines port 9000 lastly we include the docker image name in this case is “andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2” (3.2.2 is the version number, which may change at a later date. be sure to use the latest available) That’s it! if all went well, The docker should mention factorie-nlp-api - Completed in xms and you should be able to access your TAP instance by navigating to your Docker IP in a browser!

They are basically the tools required to run an SBT play application. Other dependencies are also specified in build.sbt and will be automatically downloaded during the first build.\nMany of the tools/products will be downloaded during the build as build.sbt dependencies or indirectly by other products. Perhaps you want to start with cloning and building TAP, then refer to the list in this section in response to errors to see what you might be missing.\nGit You will need the Git source control command line tools and/or a Git gui interface if you want to clone and contribute to the project, otherwise you can just download a zip of the source code. The git tools are available either through your software installation tool such as Synaptic or from the Git website. sbt sbt will build the project and download much of the needed software for us, but if it is not on our system already, we need to download it first. Even if sbt is already installed, we may need to use a different level of sbt to do the build. Once you downloaded the code, position in the ~/tap directory, and issue the following command : sbt about\n in the ~/tap directory. You should get the following output : [info] This is sbt 0.13.16\n[info] The current project is {file:~/tap/}tap 3.0.4or\n[info] The current project is built against Scala 2.12.3\n If the sbt version is different from than 0.13.16, wait until the first compile is done, and issue the check again as the sbt build should download the correct version for you. If not, download the the 0.13.16 version that is used in the project from the sbt website Scala The Scala compiler version used to compile the code is 2.12.3. This should match the run-time Scala version as Scala run-time is not backward compatible. This should be taken care of by the build.sbt file on the first compile. You can issue the following command to check your Scala version: scala -version\n This is the expected output: Scala code runner version 2.12.3 -- Copyright 2002-2017, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.:\n Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java run-time (JRE) Check that you have an up to date version of the JRE. It should be at least 1.8 (The build is tested using 1.8), otherwise you have to update the Java run time on your machine. Issue: java -version\n The JDK is also needed to compile java files in the project, and should also be at the 1.8 level. Issue : javac -version\n If the JDK or JRE are missing or at an older level, the 1.8 level can be downloaded from Oracle. Installing the JDK should take care of installing the JRE also. You should provide enough memory for the JDK and JRE to build and run this project. While TAP will run with standard memory settings, certain NLP processes which require the loading of large models will require additional memory.

If you have any suggestions for alternate ways of working with this project please let us know by opening an issue. Otherwise the following is a guide to getting setup with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nWhen you first open IntelliJ IDEA, We first want to ensure you have the correct plugins. Click configure at the bottom of the start screen and choose Plugins. Check that you have the ‘Scala’ and SBT plugins installed. If this is the first time you have run IntelliJ you most likely won’t. Click Browse Repositories at the bottom and type in Scala to search for it then click install plugin. Do the same for the plugin called SBT. Below is the plugins that you want to install. Once you have installed both plugins it will direct you to restart IntelliJ. Once restarted select ‘Import Project’ and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo too and choose the build.sbt file.\nMake sure Download library sources is ticked and that your Project JDK is chosen. If not you will need to select your JDK, You will need the 1.8 JRE and JDK found here. Then click the New Button > JDK and navigate to your java JRE In most cases it should be installed to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.x and click ok. Once you click ok IntelliJ may take a while syncing the project(20-40 minutes for first time) Keep an eye on the progress bar at the bottom and wait until it is complete. Once it has synced open the app folder and then open the view folder. Right click on HomePage and select ‘Run Play 2 App’ this will automatically generate your run configuration. It may also download a number of files that SBT needs which may take some time. Once it has compiled and built you may find it will crash with an Out Of Memory Error. Let’s fix that now. Go to the Run Menu at the top and choose ‘Edit Configuration’, There are a few things we want to change here. First we want to check that the URL to open is http://localhost:9000 Then we want to enter some custom JVM Options -Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M replacing whatever is already there. Lastly we want to enter some Environment Variables click the folder icon then the + symbol under ‘Name’ enter TAP_HOSTS and under ‘Value’ enter localhost:9000 Click Apply then ok. Great now you can right click HomePage again and select ‘Run Play 2 App’ and it should compile and load up the homepage. You are good to go!
